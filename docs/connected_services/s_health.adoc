### Synchronization

There are two sync methods:

- normal sync: saves data for the past 2 weeks. Sync happens everytime sleep tracking ends, or when you create a sleep record manually. Also everytime you start the app, if a sync did not happen in the past 24 hours.
- full sync: saves data for the past 5 years. Can be triggered from _Settings > Services > Samsung Health (you have to toggle off and on) > Upload (button in the lower right corner)_

NOTE: Heart rate data are exported/imported only for the past 7 days in both normal and full sync (because they are computationally intensive).
