- Most probably your link:../alarms/backup.html[Backup alarm] went off after regular alarm did not wake you up. Backup alarm is triggered when there is no interaction (no snooze, no dismiss) for more than 20 minutes.

- Make sure you are using volume strong enough in _Settings -> Alarms -> Ringtone_, or enable Gentle Volume increase in _Settings -> Alarms -> Gentle volume increase_
- Try vibrations (_Settings -> Alarms -> Vibrate_).
