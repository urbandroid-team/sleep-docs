There are two reasons, why the app did not record the sound, even when it was properly detected (you see the sound icon on the noise graph):

* The threshold is set too high.
* The app had troubles saving the file.

== Adjusting threshold
. Go to _Settings -> Sleep noise recording -> Recording volume threshold_.
. Lower the value - the default value is 15%

* Higher threshold = less sounds are recorded
* Lower threshold = more sounds are recorded

== Resetting storage path

. Go to _Settings -> Sleep noise recording -> Storage path_.
. Tap on RESET button.
. Now you should see the Storage path set as "/storage/emulated/0".
