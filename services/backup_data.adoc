== Local backup
[[local_backup]]
[horizontal]
Backs up:: Sleep records, Settings, Noise recordings, Noise recordings metadata, Active alarms
Does not back up:: Inactive alarms

Your data are being backed up on a daily basis to a dedicated folder on your phone (the exact location depends on the Android version, based on _Settings -> Personalize -> Privacy -> Storage path_).

You can also start local backup manually using _Left_ ☰ _menu -> Backup -> Export data_.

WARNING: Do not use if you plan to reinstall the application or delete the application data!
If you want to use manual backup for these purposes, tap the SHARE button in the dialog and save the file to another location, attach it to an email, or save it to a cloud service.

What is backed up in this folder:
[horizontal]
/rec folder:: Contains all your recorded noise files.
noise.json:: Noise metadata
prefs.xml:: Settings
sleep-export.csv:: Latest sleep data
sleep-export.backup.csv:: Sleep data from the previous backup
ZIP file:: all the above (except /rec folder) are zipped up here for easy sharing

You can also open the CSV file on your computer (e.g. in Excel) for your own analysis of the sleep tracking data. The structure of the CSV file is <</devs/csv#,documented here>>.

=== How to import / export in the app - manually
You an also do a manual export/import process:

. Go to the _Left_ ☰ _menu -> icon:ic_cloud_upload[] Backup -> Export_, and make sure the dialog says "successful".
. Copy the directory you see on the dialogue to your new phone's SD card.
. Install Sleep as Android on the new phone and immediately go to _Left_ ☰ _menu -> icon:ic_cloud_upload[] Backup -> Import_.

NOTE: If you don't import immediately, the app will replace your `sleep-export.zip` file after the next sleep record is created. The old `sleep-export.zip` file will be renamed to `sleep-export.backup.zip`. See <</faqs/backup_data_not_imported_immediately#, solution>>.

=== How to share the manually created backup
For even easier migrating to a new phone, you can use your email, or cloud storage (like)

. Go to the _Left_ ☰ _menu -> icon:ic_cloud_upload[] Backup -> Export_.
. When a dialogue "Successful backup to your local storage" appears, choose "Share" button.
. Now, you can choose your email client, and the backup zip file is attached to the body of a new email.
. Send it to yourself.
. Open the email client on your new phone, open the email, and tap on the attachment.
. You will be asked which data you wish to import - select all types of data you wish to import, and submit - <<manual_import, see how it looks like>>.


== Backup to SleepCloud (recommended)
[[sleepcloud_backup]]
[horizontal]
Backs up:: Sleep records, Settings, Active alarms, Noise recordings metadata
Does not back up:: Noise recordings, Inactive alarms

Recommended backup service. It stores data in our own cloud designed for Sleep as Android. It has several unique features not present in other backup methods.

Read <</services/sleepcloud#, more about SleepCloud addon and account here>>.

== Backup to Dropbox or Google Drive
[[dropbox]][[google_drive]]
[horizontal]
Backs up:: Sleep records, Settings, Noise recordings metadata, Alarms
Does not back up:: Noise recordings

To automatically backup your data to Dropbox or Google Drive:
. Install https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.addon.port[SleepCloud Backup add-on].
. Go to _Sleep -> Settings -> Services -> Cloud backup_ and connect either _Google Drive_ or _Dropbox_.

* The back up service will create a *Sleep as Android* folder within the Google Drive storage, and *Sleep Cloud Backup* folder within the DropBox service.

NOTE: If the backup to a cloud service fails, you will see a notification in the notification center. If this happens, please contact support@urbandroid.org.

== Backup using Google provided backup cloud
[[google_backup]]
[horizontal]
Backs up:: Sleep records, Settings, Alarms, Noise recordings metadata
Does not back up:: Noise recordings

Most Android phones support Google provided backup. This is an optional feature and it must be explicitly enabled by the user.

NOTE: We recommend using other methods, preferably <<sleepcloud_backup,SleepCloud>>, to backup your sleep records, as we have no direct control over initiation of Google backup so it may not work in all cases. This method is NOT meant to be used for synchronization of data or settings across phones.

. Enable Backup to Google One in  _System Settings -> System -> Backup_ (might be hidden under Advanced options) -> _Back up by Google One_ - the system will backup to a Google cloud automatically in background, or you can force immediate back up with "Back up now" button.

. In case you have developer tools available, you can force Google backup and restore to get reliable results. To force the backup, you can run “adb backup -f sleep-backup.bk com.urbandroid.sleep” when the old device is connected and to upload the backup to a new device run “adb restore sleep-backup.bk”.

== Import data from email, Google Drive, Dropbox

If you tap on the CSV or ZIP file that was exported from Sleep (anywhere - in your email attachment, Drive, Dropbox, file manager), the system will offer to open it with Sleep as Android. This will import the included sleep records.

== Import sleep noise files

If you wish to import sleep noise files to a new phone, you need to do this manually by copying the folder to the storage on the new phone.

. Save the content of the folder you have as your storage path on the first phone - you can find the storage path at _Settings → Sleep Noise recording → Storage path_.
. On the new phone, decide a location for your new storage path.
. If you copied the whole folder with *sleep-data* folder, copy the whole folder to the chosen location on the new phone.
. If you copied only the sound files, create folder *sleep-data* in your chosen location, and inside this folder, create a sub-folder *rec*. And copy the files to this *rec* folder.
. Choose the storage path on the new phone in _Settings → Sleep Noise recording → Storage path_ to *your_chosen_folder* (not to the *your_chosen_folder\sleep-data\rec\* subfolder).
. Sync the backup file - the sound meta-data will pair with the files copied.

NOTE: The actual sound files should be in *your_chosen_folder\sleep-data\rec\*.
