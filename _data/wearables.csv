Sony,SW3 (SWR50),true,YES (🛌️),🛌️,~15%,"182 events sensor batch queue which allows very low battery consumption (although default sensor frequency is higher than on Gear Live for example)<br>Many thanks to Sony Mobile for their great help to overcome the sensor batching which got battery consumption from ~70% to ~15% per night.
Known issue: Sometimes gets into a broken state and starts using up to 100% battery. Reboot watch to resolve the issue.
Known issue: Sometimes the Wear app doesn't install the app on your watch automatically. Sleep as Android then stays stuck on ""Waiting for connectivity"" and never connects. To resolve, go to <strong>Android Wear app > Settings > Your watch > Resync apps</strong>."

There are issues with refurbished Gear Live devices with a dev version of the OS which do not connect to with Sleep as Android. Re-flashing of the firmware <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidWear/comments/2rgx1p/no_update_on_gear_live/"">as described here</a> should resolve the issue.
