*Left ☰ menu is an expandable menu for easy navigation and quick access to features.*

Tap ☰ icon in the upper left corner or swipe from the left to expand the menu.

[NOTE]
On phones with gesture navigation you need to tap and hold instead of the swipe to access the menu.

The content of the Left menu might be influenced by the type of home screen.

. In *Tabs home screen*, the options shown as tabs are hidden. If Dashboard tab is disabled, shortcuts are added to the Left menu.
. In *Alarms only mode*, the tracking related features are hidden, if there is no tracking history.

== Chronotype

Based on your sleep patterns in tracking history, the app will determine your chronotype and shows you the icon in the Left menu - either you are morning lark, or night owl.

NOTE: The app needs to have at least one month of sleep data.

Your chronotype is then represented by a banner at the very top of the Left ☰ menu.

According to the research of professor https://www.amazon.com/Internal-Time-Chronotypes-Social-Youre-dp-0674065859/dp/0674065859/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=[Till Roenneberg],  people are born with a chronotype, and  everyone is somewhere on the spectrum from owl 100% to 100% lark. Our <</sleep/sleepcloud_study#,SleepCloud study>> also came to the same conclusion.
