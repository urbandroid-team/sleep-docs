## What it does
*Testing sensor gives you confirmation the wearable is connected properly, and the companion app is sending data about your movement.*


NOTE: Testing sensor is not supported by Garmin wearables and FitBit.



## Where to find it
_Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Test sensor_


== How it works
During the Test sensor, the app connects to the selected wearable, confirms the proper connection and then shows you the detected movement.

When the test sensor is successful, you will see a green graph reacting to your movement (with a short delay, as the data are sent in batches). The graph is labeled "Test sensor: Wearable" - the app is using data from wearable.
When the test sensor fails, it will fall back into phone's accelerometer or sonar (depending on your choice of sensor). The graph is labeled "Test sensor: Accelerometer / Sonar" - the app is using data from phone's sensor.
