== First start
. Connect your Sleep Phaser to the power supply.
. Make sure that _Bluetooth_ and _Location service_ (GPS) are turned on.
. In Sleep as Android, go to _Settings -> Services -> Smartlight -> Sleep Phaser_ and tap _Sleep Phaser (disconnected)_ (you can also just search for “sleep phaser”). The app will connect to the nearest Sleep Phaser. This will also unlock your Sleep as Android if you have the trial version.
. After a successful connection, you can activate one or more Sleep Phaser functions:

[horizontal]
  Smartlight:: Enables sunrise alarm. When this option is enabled, the general smart light options (Pee-light, Lucid dreaming, Anti-Snoring) start to apply to Sleep Phaser.
  Sleep tracking:: Enables tracking movement and breathing with Sleep Phaser
  Automatic start:: When enabled, sleep tracking will start in a standby mode (on infinite pause) whenever you connect your phone to a charger and Sleep Phaser is in Bluetooth range.

It's very simple to control the Phaser – just touch the top of the lamp. Light modes switch with every touch.

NOTE: The Phaser turns off the light after 30 minutes automatically, if not tracking.

// Other functions

// - Long-term analysis of your sleep and data storage
// - The ability to back up data to the cloud
// - Google Fit & Samsung Health Integration
// - Automation with Tasker and IFTTT

== Sleep tracking

<</sleep/sleep_tracking#,Sleep tracking>> with Sleep Phaser can be started either manually or automatically.

[horizontal]
Manual start:: In Sleep as Android app, tap the moon button. The app will connect to the Sleep Phaser and start sleep tracking right away.
Automatic start:: 	Whenever you connect your phone to a charger, Sleep checks whether you are in Sleep Phaser’s Bluetooth range. If you are (and “Start automatically” is enabled), sleep tracking will show up in a pause mode.
Once you switch off the lamp, sleep tracking will unpause and will start monitoring your sleep.

=== Positioning the device
The Phaser scans a 130-degree wide area.

In case there are more people in the bed, to prevent interference, we recommend positioning the Phaser as seen below. In this way, you get a maximum signal from yourself, while the signal from your partner is mostly blocked. The PIR sensor should point approximately to your shoulders. If you are able to see the sensor from your bed, then the sensor is able to “see” you.

=== Tracking with two Sleep Phasers (Pair tracking)
To track two people in one bed with two Phasers (Dual Phasers):

. enable _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> <</sleep/pair_tracking#,Pair tracking>>_ on both phones
. tap _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Find partner_ simultaneously on both phones.

Position the Phasers as indicated in the image below.

Pair tracking cross-checks signals from both Phasers against each other and cleans them out so any signal from your partner is removed from your data.

=== Controlling the light directly
You can control the light from the https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hecz.sleepphasercontrol[Sleep Phaser Remote Control].
This app can also alter a few internal settings of the Phaser and do firmware upgrades.

== Advice and warnings
.	To ensure proper function, keep the device clean
.	Be careful when cleaning the device, don’t let moisture get to the diodes. You alone are responsible if you destroy the device cleaning it.
.	Protect the device from fire, water, and extreme temperatures.
.	The Sleep Phaser is not made of any health damaging materials.
.	The device was carefully tested, it cannot hurt you while sleeping.
.	The package of Sleep Phaser is recyclable and must be handled in accordance with local laws. Please, protect our nature.
.	All unrecyclable parts of the Sleep Phaser must be handled in accordance with local laws.

== Troubleshooting
Things to check before any troubleshooting:

. Make sure to install the latest version of Sleep as Android
. make sure that you have Location – GPS enabled. For some reason, Android needs this enabled to do a successful Bluetooth Low Energy scan.
. make sure that you power the Sleep Phraser with at least 1A charger.
