Sleep as Android integrates Garmin wearables that support the ConnectIQ (CIQ) platform.

Does your watch support the ConnectIQ platform? https://developer.garmin.com/connect-iq/compatible-devices/[check here].

== How to set up
You will need to install the following apps:

.On the phone
. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep.garmin[Garmin Addon for Sleep as Android] from Play Store.
. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.watchsleepstarter&hl=en_US[Sleep Watch starter] from Play Store.

.On the watch
. Install the current version of the watch app https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/e80a4793-f5a3-44c7-bd7f-52a97f5d8310[thourgh the ConnectIQ Store] (Connect IQ 3.1 and higher).
. Make sure that all of the apps are installed, and then select _Sleep -> Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables -> Use wearables -> Garmin_.
. For HR data, enable *Heart rate monitoring* in _Settings -> Sleep tracking -> Wearables_.
. To start sleep tracking with your watch, tap _Start tracking_ on the <</ux/homescreen#,Homescreen>>.

.If you have troubles with muted vibrations for lucid cues or anti-snoring alerts
. On your wearable go to _Settings -> System -> Sleep mode_ and disable *DND while sleep*.
. Make sure *Status notification* and *Allow vibrations* are enabled on the wearable in _Settings > Smart notification > notifications > Overall usage and apps > Apps_

WARNING: You need to side-load a legacy version of the Sleep app, if your ConnectIQ is less than 3.1. https://sleep.urbandroid.org/more/garmin-legacy-watch-app-downloads/[Look here], find your model and put the corresponding file (Sleep.prg) onto your device, in /GARMIN/APPS folder


NOTE: Garmin integration does not support testing the sensor with <</sleep/sleep_tracking#test_sensor,Test sensor>>.

WARNING: On some watches (mainly Vivoactive 3) there is a long-standing firmware issue that prevents you from accepting the starting dialog on the watch. Please start tracking from the watch instead. See <</faqs/garmin_start_dialog_bug#,FAQ: Garmin - Cannot accept start dialog (green tick)>>
