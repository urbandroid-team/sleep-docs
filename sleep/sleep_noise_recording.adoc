== What it does
Records significant sounds while you sleep and builds a ambient noise-level graph for the night. It also <</sleep/sound_recognition#,classifies the sounds>> into categories including snoring, talk, coughing, laughter, baby cry.

NOTE: Enabling Sleep noise recording may lead to higher battery consumption during sleep tracking.


WARNING: The sleep noise recording might not work on Android 11, when the tracking is started automatically due to changes in the permissions - apps running in the background cannot ask for the mic.
To workaround this we would need to have the "Draw over other apps permission" and start a transparent short lived screen before we start the sleep tracking service.
Please see the history of the issue here:
https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/162913367


== Where to find it
_Settings -> Sleep noise recording_

You can check whether the phone is recording on the sleep tracking screen - [color-red]#red ⬤# indicates that the phone is currently recording.

On the seek bar to the right you can see current volume level and your _Recording volume threshold_ which indicates volume to start recording.
